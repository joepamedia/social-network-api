# Description 
This is a back end API that reads, updates, and deletes data from a database that uses NoSQL. The user can create a profile and thought, view other thoughts and users, update thoughts and user information, and delete thoughts and user information. This solves the issue of not having a back end for a social network. 
  
  # Installation

  # Usage
   To use this, clone my code, and in the console, run 
   ```
   npm i
   ```
   Then, seed the data using: 
   ```
   npm run seed
   ```
   Finally, run the server using:
   ```
   npm run start
   ```
   Upon the server being started, the Mongoose models and synced to MongoDB, where the data is stored. When the user enters a proper route in thunder client, it will respond back with the nested data in JSON format.
